# ANR

The dataset is an open-data one : <a href="https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/anr-01-projets-anr-dos-detail-des-projets-et-des-partenaires/"> ANR_01 Projets ANR DOS: détail des projets et des partenaires </a>


INTRODUCTION
ANR is the French institution which allocates funds to French research projects. This dataset contains the 15 k research projects that were financed by ANR since 2011. We are interested in the 2014-2021 period, when the present system, with the anual generic call weighting for 3/4 of all the calls (in €) was implemented.

In its <a href="https://anr.fr/fileadmin/aap/2022/aapg-2022-Guide-V1-0.pdf">"Guide de l’AAPG 2022"</a> p.37, ANR gives the list of the different "comités d'évaluation scientifique", which are the evaluation commitees that decide which projects get funded each year in each discipline, from the generic anual call. 

While looking at the amount of money given to research projects, and the number of projects financed in the 4 "comités d'évaluation scientifique" concerning social sciences each year, we built a first dataviz showing <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/ANR_SHS/SHS_dans_le_total?:language=fr-FR&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link">where social sciences lie within the global ANR generic call</a>, and the other thematic calls. And a second dataviz <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/ANR_SHS_et_detail_SHS/SHS_?:language=fr-FR&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link">focusing on those four social sciences CES</a>.


RESEARCH QUESTIONS
To what extent is social sciences research captured in the global ANR funding call?
Which social sciences CES are more likely to get funding?
