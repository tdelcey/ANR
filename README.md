The dataset is an open-data one : <a href="https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/anr-01-projets-anr-dos-detail-des-projets-et-des-partenaires/"> ANR_01 Projets ANR DOS: détail des projets et des partenaires </a>


INTRODUCTION

ANR is the French institution which allocates funds to French research projects. This dataset contains the 15 k research projects that were financed by ANR since 2011. We are interested in the 2014-2021 period, when the present system, with the anual generic call weighting for 3/4 of all the calls (in €) was implemented.

In its <a href="https://anr.fr/fileadmin/aap/2022/aapg-2022-Guide-V1-0.pdf">"Guide de l’AAPG 2022"</a> p.37, ANR gives the list of the different "comités d'évaluation scientifique", which are the evaluation commitees that decide which projects get funded each year in each discipline, from the generic anual call. 

Here is an example of <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/ANR_SHS/SHS_dans_le_total?:language=fr-FR&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link">where social sciences lie within the global ANR generic call</a>

While looking at the amount of money given to research projects, we looked how the funding evolving through the years according to :

- <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aef.data.sup.recherche/viz/ANR_SHS_et_detail_SHS/Categories_?publish=yes">10 disciplinary categories</a>

- <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aef.data.sup.recherche/viz/ANR_SHS_et_detail_SHS/SHS_?publish=yes">a focus on social sciences</a>

- and within social sciences, <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aef.data.sup.recherche/viz/ANR_SHS_et_detail_SHS/SHS_per_CES_?publish=yes">the detail per CES</a>

**Gender**

We looked at 

- the gender of the funded researchers <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aef.data.sup.recherche/viz/gender_per_year/gender_per_year?publish=yes"> per year </a> (women weight 1/3 basically)

- the gender of the funded researchers <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aef.data.sup.recherche/viz/gender_per_category/gender_by_category?publish=yes"> per disciplin </a> (it varies from medecine to maths)

- and realized that <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aef.data.sup.recherche/viz/ANR__per_gender/_per_year_?publish=yes"> 2018 is the only year when women got a bigger average funding than men</a> (!)

RESEARCH QUESTIONS

1) To what extent is social sciences research captured in the global ANR funding call?

2) Which social sciences CES are more likely to get funding from ANR?


METHODOLOGY

Dataset: 
The dataset is an open-data one : <a href="https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/anr-01-projets-anr-dos-detail-des-projets-et-des-partenaires/"> ANR_01 Projets ANR DOS: détail des projets et des partenaires </a>. We were interested in data from 2014-2021

Technique: 
Topic modeling. Topic modeling is a method in natural language processing (NLP) used to train machine learning models. Specifically, we adopted the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique.

IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS

For social scientists, seeking growth to their research portfolio, the findings can inform the topics to be researched upon, the type of researchers to collaborate with, and a favourable gender mix in the research team.
